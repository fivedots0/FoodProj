# Food Classification Project

## Overview
This project focuses on the task of classifying different types of food using resnet50. The goal is to build a model that can accurately identify the category of a given food item, such as whether it is a fruit, vegetable, meat, or dairy product.

## Tasks Completed
1. **Prepare Dataset**: Import the food101 dataset for training.
2. **Preprocess**: Implemented standard preprocessing techniques, such as resizing, normalization, and augmentation, to prepare the data for model training.
3. **Train/Val Split**: Divided the dataset into training and validation sets
4. **Create Training Generators**: Data generators to feed the model with batches of training and validation data during the training process.
5. **Train and Validate**: Trained and validated the model, achieving an accuracy of 81% on the validation set.

## Next Steps
1. **Deploy**: The next step is to deploy the trained model.
